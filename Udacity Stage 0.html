<!-- Before the Head and such, we have the stuff where the DOCTYPE and the references to the CSS
and the JAVASCRIPT go.  I only know how to do comments because I have done a bunch of HTML
but always forget it-->

<h3>What I should remember!</h3>

<b>What is the Web?</b>
<p>The web is something for introduced on a large scale in the early 90's. 
It is a huge network of computers that talk with one another.  When someone types in a <em>URL</em>
the computer send a <em>HTTP request</em> to a server.  This server then sends the correct information
back to the users computer, where it is interpreted by their <em>Browser</em>.(Unless it is Internet
Explorer.  In that case it will most likely just crash).
</p>

<b>What is this HTML you speak of?</b>
<p>HTML is the main language that webpages are written in.  It stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language.</em>
This language is one that computers can interpret through the Browser and display the content
of the page.<br>
Inside HTML documents you can find different elements described as follows:<br>
<li>Text - What you see.</li>

<li>2. Markup - How it appears.</li>

<li>3. References - Such as documents, videos and images.</li>

<li>4. Link - Links to other pages.</li>
</p>

<b>E.T Phone Home (Elements and Tags)</b>
<p>Within an HTML document you have <b><em>Elements</em></b>, which we describe to the browser 
by using <b><em>Tags</em></b>
  
</p>
<B>Computers are Fun, but they can be Dumb!</B>
<p>While computers are capable of doing incredibly complex operations they are easily thrown off
  by someone forgetting to close out a tag, or by someone forgetting to close the quotation marks in a link.
  That being said it is smart to use a tool like scratch pad or notepad++ so it can help you find your errors
    
  </p>
  
  <b>Inline and Block Elements</b>
  <p>This is more relevant when using CSS and Javascript, but it is a concept I was completely unaware of.
    In all my years of trying to learn to code, this concept never came up, and man is it a useful one.
    Block Elements are able to be manipulated while inline elements are just that.
